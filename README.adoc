= Borp

Borp is a project.  It is starting as just some code to help me
understand the storage format and functionality of
https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[BorgBackup].  It is not
intended (at least any time soon) to be a fully functional
replacement, but a reasonable initial goal would be an alternate
implementation that is able to restore a given backup.
